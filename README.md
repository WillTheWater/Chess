## 🛠️ The Water Engine Foundation

The Chess project is built on top of the Water Engine's core systems:

| Component | Responsibility | Status in Project |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Actor** | Base for all game objects: rendering, position, bounds checking | Essential for board/pieces |
| **World** | Handles game state, object spawning, update & render cycles | Central game orchestrator |
| **Input System** | Provides frame-by-frame mouse position queries | Fully integrated and active |

## 📌 Project Status
This is an early-stage but functional architecture, designed to be expanded into a complete chess experience.
